## About me
My name is Taein Kim, and I write a lot of software. I currently live in Seoul, South Korea.  
I'm interested in functional programming, static types, and programming language research, particularly interested in the development of security solutions and encryption programs.
and I try to spend as much
time as I can writing Haskell and Rust. I write about of the things I do on [**this blog**](https://initprism.com).
